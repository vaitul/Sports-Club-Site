        What is Lorem Ipsum?

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum 
has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
 took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
 only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
 unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
  Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
  PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of 
a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
 look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use 
 Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many 
 web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes 
 by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Where does it come from?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
 classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
  Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
  Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the 
  word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from 
  sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good 
  and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
   very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor 
   sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those 
interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero 
are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from 
the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
